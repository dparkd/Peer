		<h1>Background</h1>
		<p class="content">
			Traditional education is difficult to engage students when learning complex, invisible, and abstract science concepts. The challenge was to find out how Virtual or Augmented reality could enhance the learning experience for kids aged between 9-14.
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			Using design thinking and employing various techniques we took on the challenge of making learning more fun.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="container feature-container no-top no-bottom">
		<h1>Research</h1>
		<p class="content">
			In order to find ways to engage with students in the classroom we went out to conduct interviews, research new technologies, and experience different teaching methods.
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			To better understand how complex subjects are taught today we reached out to the <a href="http://www.blueschool.org/" target="_blank">Blue School</a>, <a href="http://beamcenter.org/" target="_blank">Beam Center</a>, and <a href="https://www.zearn.org/" target="_blank">Zearn</a> to learn more about teaching methodologies like STEAM and maker education.

		<p class="content">After gaining valuable insights in different education techniques, we went out to experience the different Virtual and Augmented technologies. All four of us got to try the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us" target="_blank">Hololens</a>, <a href="https://www.htcvive.com/us/" target="_blank">Vive</a>, <a href="https://ghostbusters.madametussauds.com/" target="_blank">Ghostbusters - the Void</a>, and even experience <a href="http://giantofficial.com/" target="_blank">Giant</a> (VR Film). We did this in order to better understand what the limitations and advantages of each technology is.</p>

		<h1>Insights and Concepting</h1>
		<p class="content">
			From the research gathered, valuable insights about the mesh between technology and education started to emerge.  We found that there were certain pain-points and bottlenecks in traditional learning and created a user journey to better understand the specifics of those learning drop-offs. From the user journey we were able to concept ideas and experiences that might improve engagement in that particular stage of learning.

		<h1>Prototyping and Design</h1>
		<p class="content">
			After all of the concepting and sketching it was time to make prototypes and get into a higher fidelity. We started initially using brightly colored paper to represent our 3D virtual objects, but once we got to a point where we were comfortable with the design we went digital with either video or a demo.

		<h1>Final Product</h1>
		<p class="content">
			After iterating over numerous designs, the team agreed on a final experience and product. The final deliverable for us was a presentation to the entire Moment company showcasing Peer as an educational learning platform meshing the digital with the physical.
